# Walking Skeleton

Walking Skeleton is a client/server system for the support of workflow management developed by a group of ten students during our studies at the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences. The development took place in a fifth semester course called Software Engineering Project lectured by Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Weitz in summer 2015.

You can browse the [javadoc](https://redhilarious.github.io/WalkingSkeleton/documentation/server/index.html) for further information about the server or the [doxygen](https://redhilarious.github.io/WalkingSkeleton/documentation/client/index.html) generated documentation for more information about the client.
